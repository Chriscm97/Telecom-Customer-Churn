# Telecom-Customer-Churn

In the recent years, due to rapid advancements in the telecom domain and today’s generation 
moving towards a more smartphone dominated era, Internet availability has become a necessity 
and requirement. The telecom market has become fiercer and extremely competitive with the 
service providers doing everything in their capacity in providing the best services which is 
economical for their valued customers. Churn in simple terms can be stated as a process wherein 
a customer suspends or cancels service with the provider. Recent survey result in the telecom 
industry explicitly states that the cost of acquiring new customers is far greater than retaining 
their existing customer base. Hence, to retain their customer base, it is valuable to know which 
customers are likely going to switch to other providers in the near future making Customer Churn 
prediction a valuable tool at their disposal in order to survive in this competitive environment. 
The data collected from the telecom industry can help in analyzing the reasons of customer churn 
and in turn use that information to retain customers. The main goal of this project is to analyze 
the reasons behind churning and focuses on various machine learning techniques for predicting 
customer churn through which we can build the classification models such as Logistic Regression, 
SVM, Random Forest, KNN and Naïve Bayes and also compare the performance of these models
using metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, f-measure, and receiving operating 
characteristics (ROC) area.
